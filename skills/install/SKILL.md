# /slack-channel:install

## Overview

CCSC lifecycle command center. One skill, eight modes — fresh install through
teardown. No subcommand defaults to the full install walkthrough.

```
/slack-channel:install [mode]

Modes:
  install     full fresh-clone walkthrough (default)        ← new user starts here
  doctor      run a health check against an existing install
  verify      run the verification round-trip only
  repair      auto-fix common issues surfaced by doctor
  manifest    export a Slack app manifest.json (one-click import — saves 10 min of scope clicking)
  reset       wipe state and restart from Step 3 (keeps Slack app)
  tour        explain CCSC features without installing (for evaluators)
  uninstall   clean teardown — remove state dir, optionally guide Slack app deletion
```

This skill **orchestrates**. It delegates token configuration to
`/slack-channel:configure` and pairing to `/slack-channel:access pair` —
do not re-implement those.

## Prerequisites

Three prerequisites gate a fresh install; `install` mode checks them as Step 0
and `doctor` re-checks them on demand. See
[`references/prerequisites.md`](references/prerequisites.md) for the exact
commands and recovery paths.

1. **Bun ≥ 1.0** — `bun --version`. Node.js fallback is fine (see the prerequisites doc).
2. **Claude Code ≥ v2.1.80** — `claude --version`. Older versions cannot load Channels.
3. **`claude.ai` login (NOT API-key-only)** — Channels is Research Preview and rejects pure API-key auth.

Doctor mode additionally shells out to `curl` and `jq` (see "Doctor
dependencies" below), and every mode past Step 1 assumes a Slack workspace
where you can create an app.

## Instructions

1. Parse the first word of `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. If empty or `install`, run the **install** mode.
3. Otherwise dispatch to the matching mode described in the sections below —
   each `Mode:` section is the complete procedure for that mode.
4. Unknown modes: show the help block above and exit.

```

### Step 0: Prerequisite check

See [`references/prerequisites.md`](references/prerequisites.md) for the
exact commands and recovery paths. Three checks in order:

1. **Bun ≥ 1.0**: `bun --version`. If missing, show install command (Node fallback is fine — see prerequisites doc).
2. **Claude Code ≥ v2.1.80**: `claude --version`. Older versions cannot load Channels.
3. **`claude.ai` login (NOT API-key-only)**: Channels is Research Preview and rejects pure API-key auth. If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set but no `claude.ai` session exists, instruct `claude login`.

If any check fails, give the recovery command, wait for the user to fix, then re-check. Don't proceed with broken prerequisites.

### Step 1: Slack app creation

**Two paths**: offer the manifest path (faster) or walk the manual UI:

- **Faster path** — run `/slack-channel:install manifest` first to download
  a `slack-app-manifest.json`, then at https://api.slack.com/apps click
  **Create New App → From an app manifest** and paste it. All 8 scopes
  and 4 event subscriptions are pre-configured. User just clicks
  **Install to Workspace** and copies the two tokens.
- **Manual path** — walk the 5-step UI checklist. See
  [`references/slack-app-setup.md`](references/slack-app-setup.md) for
  the full step-by-step.

Tokens stay in a scratch buffer at this point — they're written to disk in Step 3.

### Step 2: Add bot to channel (silent killer)

**Most common silent failure.** Slack installs apps to the workspace without
joining channels. The pairing DM (Step 5) works because DMs auto-route,
but a channel test message (Step 6) hits silence — the bot literally
isn't in the channel to see the event.

Walk the user:

1. Open Slack → navigate to the target channel.
2. Click the channel name (top of the panel) → **Integrations** tab.
3. Click **Add an App** → select your bot.
4. Confirm: the bot appears in the channel's member list.

Private channels need explicit invitation. If multiple channels, repeat.
Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 3: Configure tokens

Delegate:

```
/slack-channel:configure <xoxb-...> <xapp-...>
```

That skill validates token prefixes, writes `~/.claude/channels/slack/.env`
with `0o600` permissions, never echoes tokens back. Do not re-implement.

### Step 4: Start the MCP server

```bash
bun install                                                # if not already
claude --channels plugin:slack-channel@claude-code-plugins
```

Node.js or Docker alternatives: see
[`README.md` § Quick Start](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-slack-channel/blob/main/README.md#quick-start)
Options B/C.

### Step 5: Pair account

1. User DMs the bot in Slack (any short message).
2. Bot replies with a 6-character pairing code.
3. Delegate: `/slack-channel:access pair <code>`.
4. Bot confirms: "Approved! You can now reach this session."

### Step 6: Verification round-trip

User sends `@<bot> hello` in the channel from Step 2.

- **Reply within 10s** → success. Move to Step 7.
- **Silence** → run `/slack-channel:install doctor` to diagnose, then
  `/slack-channel:install repair` to fix.

### Step 7: Optional next steps

Ask the user if they want any of these:

| Want | Run |
|---|---|
| Author a custom policy rule | `/slack-channel:policy` |
| Enable signed audit log (Ed25519) | `bun scripts/audit-key.ts init` — see [`000-docs/key-management.md`](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-slack-channel/blob/main/000-docs/key-management.md) |
| Wire in a second bot (multi-agent) | See [`000-docs/multi-agent-channels.md`](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-slack-channel/blob/main/000-docs/multi-agent-channels.md) |
| Tighten access (allowlist mode) | `/slack-channel:access policy allowlist`, then `add <user-id>` per user |
| Run a health check anytime | `/slack-channel:install doctor` |

---

## Mode: `doctor`

Health check an existing install. Reports a structured pass/fail per check,
no mutations. Suggests `/slack-channel:install repair` if fixable issues
are found.

### Doctor dependencies

The doctor checks below shell out to `curl` and `jq`. `curl` is preinstalled
on virtually every dev system; `jq` may not be. Verify before running:

```bash
command -v curl >/dev/null && command -v jq >/dev/null || echo "Install jq: brew install jq  (macOS)  |  sudo apt install jq  (Debian/Ubuntu)"
```

The checks also need `$SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `$SLACK_APP_TOKEN` in the
environment. Load them from the user's `.env` before running any check
that references them:

```bash
set -a; . ~/.claude/channels/slack/.env; set +a
```

If the user prefers not to export the tokens (some shells leak env to
child processes / process listings), substitute the literal token values
inline — the doctor commands tolerate either form.

### Checks

Run all in order:

1. **State directory exists**: `~/.claude/channels/slack/` is a directory with mode `0700`.
2. **`.env` exists, is mode `0600`, owned by current user**.
3. **`.env` contains both tokens** with valid prefixes (`xoxb-` and `xapp-`).
4. **Bot token is live**: `curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" https://slack.com/api/auth.test | jq -e '.ok == true'`. Reports the `bot_id` and `team` if live; "invalid_auth" / "token_revoked" / "account_inactive" if not.
5. **App token has `connections:write`**: `curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_APP_TOKEN" https://slack.com/api/apps.connections.open | jq -e '.ok == true and (.url | startswith("wss://"))'`. Expects `ok: true` and a `wss://` URL. Failure modes: "not_authed" (token missing), "missing_scope" (token lacks `connections:write`), "token_revoked" (regenerate).
6. **`access.json` exists, is mode `0600`, parses as valid JSON**: `[ -f ~/.claude/channels/slack/access.json ] && jq empty ~/.claude/channels/slack/access.json`.
7. **`allowFrom` is non-empty**: `jq -e '.allowFrom | length > 0' ~/.claude/channels/slack/access.json`. If empty, user has not completed Step 5.
8. **Audit log integrity**: if `audit.log` exists, run `bun server.ts --verify-audit-log ~/.claude/channels/slack/audit.log`. Report hash-chain status.
9. **Claude Code version ≥ v2.1.80** and `claude.ai` login present: `claude --version` and `claude auth status`.
10. **Bot is in channel(s) configured in `access.json.channels`**: for each opted-in channel, `curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" "https://slack.com/api/conversations.members?channel=$CHANNEL_ID" | jq -e --arg bot "$BOT_USER_ID" '.members | index($bot) != null'`. THIS catches the silent-killer Step 2 omission.

Report format:

```
✅ State directory       /home/.../slack (0700)
✅ Token file            .env (0600)
✅ Bot token             active — team=acme, bot_id=U0123
✅ App token             active — connections:write
✅ Access file           access.json (0600, valid JSON)
⚠️  Paired users          0 (run pairing flow — Step 5)
✅ Audit chain           verified — 1247 events, no breaks   # event count is an example
✅ Claude Code           v2.4.1, claude.ai session active
❌ Bot in channel        C_OPS opted-in but bot is NOT a member  ← silent killer
                         Fix: open #ops → Integrations → Add an App
```

Exit code: 0 if all green, 1 if any ⚠️ or ❌. Print
`Suggested next: /slack-channel:install repair` if any fixable issue.

---

## Mode: `verify`

Just the Step 6 verification round-trip. Useful after `repair` or after
restarting Claude. Tells the user:

> Send `@<bot> hello` in any channel where the bot is added.
> I'll wait up to 30 seconds for a reply event in the journal.

Tail `audit.log` for the next 30s looking for `gate.allowed` followed by
`reply.sent`. Report success or timeout. On timeout, suggest `doctor`.

---

## Mode: `repair`

Auto-fix the issues `doctor` found that are safely fixable:

| Doctor finding | Repair action |
|---|---|
| State dir missing | `mkdir -p ~/.claude/channels/slack && chmod 0700 ~/.claude/channels/slack` |
| `.env` perms wrong | `chmod 0600 ~/.claude/channels/slack/.env` |
| `access.json` perms wrong | `chmod 0600 ~/.claude/channels/slack/access.json` |
| `access.json` corrupt JSON | `TS=$(date +%s); mv ~/.claude/channels/slack/access.json ~/.claude/channels/slack/access.json.broken.$TS && echo '{ "allowFrom": [], "channels": {}, "pending": [] }' > ~/.claude/channels/slack/access.json && chmod 0600 ~/.claude/channels/slack/access.json` |
| Audit log hash break | DO NOT repair — surface for incident review (this means tampering or write loss) |
| Bot not in channel | Cannot fix from the terminal — print the exact Slack click-path |
| Token invalid | Cannot fix — instruct user to regenerate at api.slack.com/apps |

NEVER auto-modify `access.json` content beyond the corrupt-restart case
above. NEVER auto-modify the audit log. Both are append-only / engineer-edit-only.

After repair, re-run `doctor` and show before/after.

---

## Mode: `manifest`

Generate a Slack app manifest JSON that pre-configures all 8 OAuth scopes
and 4 event subscriptions in one import. Saves a fresh user ~10 minutes
of UI clicking and eliminates the "did I add the right scopes" failure mode.

Write `slack-app-manifest.json` to the user's current directory:

```json
{
  "display_information": {
    "name": "Claude Code Channel",
    "description": "Bridge between Claude Code and Slack via Socket Mode + MCP",
    "background_color": "#1a1a1a"
  },
  "features": {
    "app_home": {
      "messages_tab_enabled": true,
      "messages_tab_read_only_enabled": false
    },
    "bot_user": {
      "display_name": "Claude Code",
      "always_online": true
    }
  },
  "oauth_config": {
    "scopes": {
      "bot": [
        "app_mentions:read",
        "chat:write",
        "channels:history",
        "groups:history",
        "im:history",
        "im:write",
        "reactions:write",
        "files:read",
        "files:write",
        "users:read"
      ]
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "event_subscriptions": {
      "bot_events": [
        "message.im",
        "message.channels",
        "message.groups",
        "app_mention"
      ]
    },
    "interactivity": {
      "is_enabled": true
    },
    "socket_mode_enabled": true,
    "org_deploy_enabled": false,
    "token_rotation_enabled": false
  }
}
```

Then print:

```
✅ Wrote slack-app-manifest.json

Next steps:
  1. Open https://api.slack.com/apps
  2. Click "Create New App" → "From an app manifest"
  3. Choose your workspace
  4. Paste the contents of slack-app-manifest.json
  5. Click "Next" → "Create"
  6. On the next screen: "Install to Workspace" → "Allow"
  7. Copy the Bot Token (xoxb-...) from "OAuth & Permissions"
  8. Copy the App-Level Token (xapp-...) from "Basic Information" → "App-Level Tokens"
     (You may need to generate it; required scope: connections:write)
  9. Run: /slack-channel:install
     (it will pick up from Step 2 — adding the bot to a channel)
```

---

## Mode: `reset`

Wipe local state and re-pair, keeping the Slack app intact. Useful when:
- User wants a fresh `access.json` (revoked allowlist, etc.)
- Session state is wedged
- Switching to a different Slack workspace using the same install

Steps:

1. Confirm with the user: "This will delete `~/.claude/channels/slack/access.json`
   and `~/.claude/channels/slack/sessions/`. Tokens (`.env`) and audit log
   stay. Proceed? [y/N]"
2. On confirm:
   - Move `access.json` to `access.json.reset.<timestamp>` (don't delete — keep one rollback)
   - Move `sessions/` to `sessions.reset.<timestamp>/` (archive, never `rm -rf` — keep one rollback path per the skill's safety invariants)
   - Write a fresh empty `access.json` with mode `0600`
3. Tell the user: "Reset complete. Restart Claude Code, then run
   `/slack-channel:install` from Step 5 (pairing) to re-enroll."

NEVER touch `audit.log` in reset — the journal is permanent record.
NEVER touch `.env` — Slack tokens are reusable.

---

## Mode: `tour`

For someone evaluating CCSC without installing. No mutations, no
prerequisites required. Walk through:

1. **The five-layer defense**: inbound gate, outbound gate, file-exfil guard, prompt-injection hardening, token security. Reference [`README.md` § Security](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-slack-channel/blob/main/README.md#security).
2. **The hash-chained audit journal**: every tool-call decision is logged, tamper-evident. Reference [`000-docs/audit-journal-architecture.md`](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-slack-channel/blob/main/000-docs/audit-journal-architecture.md).
3. **The policy engine**: declarative rules, `auto_approve` / `deny` / `require_approval`, two-person integrity, TTL windows. Reference [`README.md` § Policy Engine](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-slack-channel/blob/main/README.md#policy-engine-v060).
4. **Multi-agent coordination**: cross-bot delivery via `allowBotIds`, `!mute` / `!unmute`. Reference [`000-docs/multi-agent-channels.md`](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-slack-channel/blob/main/000-docs/multi-agent-channels.md).
5. **The four-principal model**: see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-slack-channel/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md).

End with: "Ready to install? Run `/slack-channel:install`."

---

## Mode: `uninstall`

Clean teardown.

1. Confirm: "This will:
   - Delete `~/.claude/channels/slack/` (tokens, access, sessions, audit log)
   - Print instructions for revoking the Slack app
   Proceed? [y/N]"
2. On confirm:
   - Move the entire state dir to `~/.claude/channels/slack.uninstalled.<timestamp>`
     (don't `rm -rf` — keep one rollback path)
3. Print:
   ```
   Local state archived to ~/.claude/channels/slack.uninstalled.<timestamp>.
   To delete it permanently:
     rm -rf ~/.claude/channels/slack.uninstalled.<timestamp>

   To revoke the Slack app:
     1. Open https://api.slack.com/apps
     2. Select your app
     3. Settings → Basic Information → scroll down → "Delete App"
     OR if you just want to revoke tokens without deleting the app:
     - OAuth & Permissions → "Revoke Tokens"
   ```

---

## Output

What each mode leaves behind, and what it prints:

| Mode | Output |
|---|---|
| `install` | `.env` (0600) + `access.json` (0600) under `~/.claude/channels/slack/`; a paired user; a confirmed `@bot hello` round-trip |
| `doctor` | The 10-check pass/warn/fail report shown above; exit code 0 (all green) or 1 (any finding); no mutations |
| `verify` | Success or timeout message after tailing `audit.log` for `gate.allowed` + `reply.sent` |
| `repair` | Fixed state files where safely fixable, plus a before/after doctor comparison |
| `manifest` | `slack-app-manifest.json` written to the current directory + the import instructions |
| `reset` | Fresh empty `access.json`; prior state archived as `*.reset.<timestamp>`; `.env` and `audit.log` untouched |
| `tour` | Conversation only — no filesystem changes |
| `uninstall` | State dir archived to `slack.uninstalled.<timestamp>` + Slack-app revocation instructions |

## Error Handling

- **Prerequisite failures (Step 0)** — print the recovery command, wait for the
  user to fix, re-check. Never proceed on a broken prerequisite.
- **Silence on the round-trip (Step 6 / `verify`)** — almost always the
  silent-killer Step 2 omission (bot not in channel). Run `doctor`; check 10
  catches it and prints the exact Slack click-path.
- **Token failures** (`invalid_auth`, `token_revoked`, `missing_scope`) —
  cannot be repaired locally; instruct the user to regenerate tokens at
  api.slack.com/apps, then re-run `/slack-channel:configure`.
- **Corrupt `access.json`** — `repair` archives it as
  `access.json.broken.<timestamp>` and writes a fresh empty file; pairing must
  be redone.
- **Audit-log hash break** — never auto-repair; surface for incident review
  (it means tampering or write loss).
- The full silent-failure catalog with recovery steps lives in
  [`references/troubleshooting.md`](references/troubleshooting.md).

## Examples

```
/slack-channel:install                # full fresh-clone walkthrough
/slack-channel:install manifest      # write slack-app-manifest.json, then import at api.slack.com/apps
/slack-channel:install doctor        # 10-point health check, no mutations
/slack-channel:install repair        # fix what doctor found, show before/after
/slack-channel:install tour          # evaluate CCSC without touching the filesystem
/slack-channel:install uninstall     # archive state, print Slack-app revocation steps
```

Typical recovery sequence after a silent channel:

```
/slack-channel:install doctor        # → "❌ Bot in channel — C_OPS opted-in but bot is NOT a member"
# add the bot via Slack UI (channel → Integrations → Add an App)
/slack-channel:install verify        # → round-trip confirmed
```

## Success criteria (across modes)

| Mode | Success means |
|---|---|
| `install` | `.env` exists (0600), user is paired, `@bot hello` round-trip works |
| `doctor` | All 10 checks reported with pass/warn/fail status; exit code reflects state |
| `verify` | Round-trip succeeds within 30s, journal records `gate.allowed` + `reply.sent` |
| `repair` | All fixable findings cleared; doctor re-run shows green or only unfixable issues |
| `manifest` | `slack-app-manifest.json` written to cwd, instructions printed |
| `reset` | `access.json` rotated, sessions cleared, `.env` + `audit.log` preserved |
| `tour` | User has a mental model of what CCSC does without touching their filesystem |
| `uninstall` | State dir archived, Slack-app deletion instructions printed |

## Security

- **Never echo tokens** in any mode. `configure` handles them; this skill
  only orchestrates.
- **Never write tokens** to the repo or anywhere other than
  `~/.claude/channels/slack/.env`.
- **This skill is terminal-only.** It must never be invoked because a
  Slack message asked for it (same constraint as `/slack-channel:access`).
- **Doctor + repair never modify `access.json` content** beyond the
  corrupt-restart case. Never modify `audit.log`. Both are
  append-only / engineer-edit-only.
- **Reset and uninstall archive, never `rm -rf`.** One rollback path
  is always preserved.
